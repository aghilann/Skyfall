<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
- [x] Set Up Database
  - [x] Spent time researching how much info should really be in a user table and what should be relational
  - [x] Setup the Postgres server in Microsoft Azure along with it's resource group 

- [x] Set Up Server
  - [x] Set up TS for ExpressJS
  - [x] Setup ESLint and Prettier
  - [x] Created a Postgres DB on Azure and connected it to server
  - [x] Organized files into MVC design pattern - no views since backend functions as Restful JSON API
  - [x] Created Routes and Controllers for Sign-Up and Sign-in with Error Handling for every unqique sitation (eg. user with email exists) 
- [x] Setting up Client
  - [x] Created Vite Project and setup Mantine
  - [x] Established different Routes with React Router
  - [x] Set up Redux and RTK Query Boilerplate
  - [x] Used Framer Motion to animate these routers to add a transition between pages.
- [x] Hard Work Begins
  - [x] Got a prebuilt Navigation Bar from Mantine UI but heavily edited it to handle re-routing and added mobile responsiveness with Media Queries
  - [x] Set up the Sign-Up Sign-In Page, most of the work was connecting the UI to server. Done with native fetch and async await, not RTK Query
  - [x] Set up a singular routes for legacies, created a table for legacies with a foreign key constraint to users
  - [ ] With the getLegacy route established, begun work on stateful table with fully mutable data - data fetched using RTK Query
   - [ ] This task is proving to be very difficult, multiple more routes most be created, decisions must be made on when to call the API 
   - [ ] Need to add the ability for users to add files and send it directly from the client to the Azure Blob
